   >>code walkthrough >>oops1.py file
   >>attrubute get called itself,  but methods are called manually >>>oops2.py
   >> so what was need of the called itself??
   ----- because we supposed to some functions that should run automatically without any intervention of user, like connecting,
   to database in backend, connecting to internet, becasue we don't expect a non tech user that he will coneect it.
3.why python is called oop??   everything in python is object(eg data str, data type like strings, int are itself are class and much more)
4.advantages of oops
   >>you can create your own datatype(not needed much at this level)
   >>  debugging
   >> easy to collab
   >>code reuseability( code written in one program can be used in other aswell)
